Google Contacts for Mutt

A simple perl script which helps you to integrate your Google Contacts
with mutt email client.


Installation

First you need to set up your account. For that, create a file in your
home directory, named ".google.ini". Fill that file with the following
content:

[account]
email = 'example@gmail.com'
password = 'yourGooglePassword'

[account1]
email = 'your-other-account@gmail.com'
password = 'passwordForYourOtherGmailAccount'

Replace the values to your login data.

You can list more than one account, by increment a counter after the 'account' in the key.

After that you can try it. Just run the contacts.pl script, then you
will receive your contact list.

Then open your .muttrc, and set for the
query_command. For example:

set query_command="/home/username/google/contacts/contacts.pl '%s'"

Change the path if it's necessary. The %s will represent the pattern
what you will search for. After the change, when you composing a mail
and in the "To:" state you press Ctrl+t, the Mutt will use the
script to complete the email address.
